# 🪙 Online Coin Toss (Baised)

A simple and realistic online coin toss application designed for sports toss scenarios.

The system listens silently in the background and detects the caller’s choice naturally during conversation. The coin flips when the flip button is pressed and resolves once a valid call is detected.
